#### How bad is littering in Malaysia?

#### Why do people litter?
Attitude was cited as main factor (Greenspaces, Intention). Other factors include norms, knowledge, limitations, etc. Some socio-economic factors influence littering (Scotland)

Individual Factors (Scotland)
- Personal responsility towards litter
- Socio-economic factors
- Feelings and relationship towards community
- What counts as litter? (weak)
- Desire to be rid of 'ick' factor
- Range of deeper personal influences like guilt, fear, sense of identity

Community Factors
- Norms of littering
- Family and upbringing
- Whether friends litter, peer effect stronger than family

Material factors
- likely that a littered site will be littered more
- existing litter indicates social acceptability / norm. already counted as dirty
- time?
- overall cleanliness of area (graffiti etc.)
- locations which are regularly cleaned (no personal responsibility)
- anonymous locations (car)
- lack of bins and ashtrays. also the cleanliness of existing bins. both of these are cited by people to justify littering
- impact of bins on littering is mixed

Enforcement
- Fines and enforcement also have mixed impacts, maybe geographic
- May encourage more surreptitious littering but highlighting enforcement and fines can be influential

Habitual factors
- Research shows there are people who are consciously aware and not consciously aware of littering
- Anti-littering interventions & specific calls to action can disrupt habits and impact change

#### What are ways of overcoming this problem?
Intervention
- So why do you do it here
